# The coder package

This package allows to format in \LaTeX\ the documentation put in the code,
as soon as long comments exist. It also allows to work the other way round
by putting code inside the documentation.
This is particularly interesting when different code files share some logic
and should be documented all at once.

The file coder-manual.pdf gives different examples.

The file coder-beamer.pdf gives a demo of what can be achieved with beamer.

This LaTeX package requires LuaTeX and may use syntax coloring based on the pygments package.
