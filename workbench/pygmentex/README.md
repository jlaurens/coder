# The coder package

Usually, documentation is put inside the code,
the coder package allows to work the other way round
by putting code inside the documentation.
This is particularly interesting when different code files share some logic
and should be documented all at once.

The file coder-manual.pdf gives different examples.

The file coder-beamer.pdf gives a demo of what can be achieved with beamer.

This LaTeX package requires LuaTeX and may use syntax coloring based on the pygments package.
